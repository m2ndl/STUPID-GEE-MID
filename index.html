            <button class="accordion">1. Defining the Field: DA vs. Related Concepts</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><strong>Pragmatics:</strong> The study of how <strong>context</strong> shapes the <strong>interpretation</strong> of utterances. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 174]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: The sentence "I died" means something different when said by a video game player versus a religious convert. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 175]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Discourse Analysis (Traditional):</strong> The study of language structure <strong>beyond the sentence</strong>, focusing on how sentences are organized into coherent texts (like stories, reports, or arguments). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 176]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Discourse Analysis (Author's Definition):</strong> A <strong>merged</strong> definition that combines both of the above. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 177]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is "the study of the use and impact of oral or written language in <strong>conveying and shaping ideas and social realities</strong>". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 178]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Discourse (Foucault's Definition):</strong> A much broader, non-linguistic concept. It refers to a complete system of <strong>knowledge, social practices, institutions, and power relations</strong> that shapes social reality. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 179]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: The "discourse of madness" describes how society (through institutions, laws, and medicine) has treated madness differently over time, framing it as wisdom, then illness, and now (for some) as "neurodiversity". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 180]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Contrast:</strong> The author's <strong>Discourse Analysis</strong> is <strong>linguistic</strong> (about language-in-use). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 181]</cite> Foucault's <strong>Discourse</strong> is <strong>sociological</strong> (about systems of power and knowledge). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 182]</cite></p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">2. The Core of Meaning: Grammar's Role</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><strong>Semantics (System Meaning):</strong> The basic, literal, abstract, or "dictionary" meaning of a word or sentence, as defined by the rules of grammar, <strong>independent of any context</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 184]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: The <strong>system meaning</strong> of "Alman is dead" is simply that a person named Alman is "now not alive". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 185]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Situational Meaning:</strong> The specific, adapted, and nuanced meaning that arises when language is used <strong>in an actual context</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 186]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the primary focus of Discourse Analysis. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 187]</cite></li>
                    <li>Example: The <strong>situational meaning</strong> of "Alman is dead" could be that his video game character died, or that he is spiritually "dead to his old self". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 188]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Connection:</strong> Discourse analysis studies how speakers and listeners use <strong>context</strong> to move from the abstract <strong>System Meaning</strong> (semantics) to a specific <strong>Situational Meaning</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 189]</cite></p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">3. Grammar as a Perspective-Taking Device</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This concept states that grammar provides a set of patterns that frame or "spin" reality in different ways. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 191]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Locator Pattern:</strong> A grammatical structure that locates a person or thing in <strong>relation</strong> to something else (a place, a group, or an abstract scale). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 192]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It describes a <strong>relational property</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 193]</cite></li>
                    <li>Example: "John is <strong>in the 90th percentile</strong>" or "Johnnie is a <strong>'3' on the state test</strong>". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 194]</cite></li>
                    <li>These are not inherent facts about John, but his position relative to a test. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 195]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Personal Property Pattern:</strong> A grammatical structure that attributes an <strong>inherent, internal quality</strong> or trait to a person. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 196]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: "John is <strong>cautious</strong>" or "John is <strong>honorable</strong>". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 197]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Category Error:</strong> The crucial mistake of treating a <strong>Locator Pattern</strong> statement <strong>as if</strong> it were a <strong>Personal Property Pattern</strong> statement. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 198]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: The teachers in the transcript <strong>slide</strong> from "Johnnie is a '3'" (Locator) to discussing the <strong>inherent properties</strong> of a "3" (e.g., being "self-initiated"). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 199]</cite></li>
                    <li>They are turning an external test score into an internal personality trait. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 200]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Transfer Pattern:</strong> A grammatical structure that frames an event as the <strong>transfer of a thing</strong> (physical or abstract) from one person to another. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 201]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: "Mary taught biology to the students". This frames teaching as a <strong>transfer of content</strong> (biology) from teacher to student. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 202]</cite></li>
                    <li>Contrast: This perspective differs from a Socratic view (drawing knowledge <strong>out</strong> of a student) or a skill-based view ("Mary taught the students <strong>how to do</strong> biology"). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 203]</cite></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">4. Communicative Tasks (The "Tools" of DA)</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><strong>Recipient Design (Speaker Task):</strong> How a speaker <strong>tailors</strong> their communication (style, tone, word choice) to fit their specific audience's perceived knowledge, status, or expectations. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 205]</cite></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Positioning Design (Speaker Task):</strong> How a speaker uses language to frame a specific <strong>relationship</strong> by: <cite>[cite: 206]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Positioning <strong>themselves</strong> (e.g., as an "authority" or "friend"). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 207]</cite></li>
                    <li>Attempting to get the listener to accept the <strong>corresponding</strong> identity (e.g., as a "subordinate" or "person needing advice"). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 208]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Situational Meaning Creation (Listener Task):</strong> The listener's active process of <strong>interpreting</strong> the speaker's language by using context to understand the intended situational meaning. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 209]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Response Design (Listener Task):</strong> The active, internal process where a listener prepares a response, which includes deciding whether to <strong>accept or reject</strong> the speaker's <strong>Positioning Design</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 210]</cite></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-vernacular (Specialist):</strong> The language of specialist groups (e.g., the "way with words" of lawyers, doctors, gamers). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 213]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Vernacular:</strong> The "everyday" language used to enact an "everyday person" identity, learned from family and community. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 214]</cite></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Bid (for identity):</strong> An <strong>attempt</strong> by a speaker to get a specific socially significant identity recognized by others. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 215]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bid can succeed, fail, or be negotiated. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 216]</cite></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is "interactive identity-based communication using language" (i.e., language-in-use). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 218]</cite></li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>"Discourse" (Big D):</strong> This is the <strong>full performance</strong> of a socially significant identity. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 220]</cite></p>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>They are <strong>constructs</strong> based on our unique human sensory organs (a bee or a bat perceives a flower completely differently), cognitive processes, and the categories our language and culture provide <cite>[cite: 4]</cite>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Building with Language:</strong> The central theme is that humans use language to do more than just <strong>describe</strong> the world; [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 5]</cite> we use it to <strong>actively build and shape our social realities</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 6]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Direct Speech Acts:</strong> These are the simplest examples of "building with language." [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 7]</cite></p>

                    <li><strong>Key Connection:</strong> This connects to the "chicken and egg" problem: the <strong>practice</strong> (like a meeting) gives our words meaning, but our <strong>words</strong> are what <strong>enact</strong> the practice and make it exist.

                    <li><strong>Key Tactic:</strong> We often build our own identity by simultaneously building or <strong>attributing</strong> an identity to <strong>others</strong>, often in comparison or contrast. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 29]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Speaking as the "chair" of the committee (formal identity) versus speaking as a "peer/colleague" (informal identity). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 30]</cite></li>

                <p>This example shows how all seven tasks work together in a real conversation. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 55]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> A tense "town-gown" (university vs. local) relationship. A university professor (Sara) gets access to a public school teacher's (Karen) class by going through an administrator, which is a breach of protocol and seen as a power move. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 56]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>The Key Quote (Karen):</strong> "I <strong>DID</strong> call her. And we <strong>BOTH</strong> expected to be around for the Summer Institute... I <strong>DID</strong> participate in it, but <strong>SARA</strong> wasn't able to do <strong>THAT</strong>." [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 57]</cite></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>The 7-Task Analysis:</strong> <cite>[cite: 58]</cite></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Karen uses stress ("DID," "BOTH," "SARA") and a "but..." contrast to make Sara's absence <strong>highly significant</strong> and not just a trivial fact. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 59]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Practices:</strong> She is officially "giving a history" of the project, but she is <strong>using</strong> this practice to do social work (i.e., establish a hierarchy). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 60]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Identities:</strong> She builds her <strong>own</strong> identity as a responsible, proactive "do-er" while building Sara's identity as a "not-doer" who is less committed. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 61]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> She builds a "distanced but not particularly deferential" relationship with Sara (who is sitting right there). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 62]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Politics:</strong> She denies Sara the "social good" of being a responsible partner, which is part of the larger <strong>political</strong> struggle over status between the university and the teachers. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 63]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Connections:</strong> She explicitly <strong>connects</strong> her action ("I DID participate") to Sara's inaction ("but SARA wasn't") to create a damning contrast. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 64]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Sign Systems & Knowledge:</strong> This exchange is the <strong>start</strong> of a long struggle over whose knowledge (professor's "research" vs. teacher's "classroom" knowledge) will be privileged in the project. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 65]</cite></li>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>These are important "meta" ideas from the chapter about <strong>how</strong> to do discourse analysis. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 67]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>Language as "Old and New":</strong> Language is like music. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 68]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every time we speak, what we say is <strong>"old"</strong> because it follows the shared <strong>conventions</strong> and <strong>grammar</strong> of our social languages. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 69]</cite></li>
                    [cite_start]<li>At the same time, it is <strong>"new"</strong> because it is a <strong>unique performance</strong> by an individual, expressing their specific meaning and style <cite>[cite: 70]</cite>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Analysis is Hypothesis-Driven:</strong> Discourse analysis is an empirical investigation, not math. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 71]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goal is to formulate <strong>hypotheses</strong>, not "definitive proof." [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 72]</cite></li>
                    [cite_start]<li>You must always be open to disconfirming evidence <cite>[cite: 73]</cite>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Context-to-Language-to-Context:</strong> Analysis is a "two-way process." [cite_start]You use information about the <strong>context</strong> to form hypotheses about the <strong>language</strong>, and then you use a close study of the <strong>language</strong> to learn more about the <strong>context</strong> and how the speakers were interpreting it <cite>[cite: 74]</cite>.</p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>The "Alternative Formulations" Test:</strong> A key method to figure out what a piece of language is <strong>doing</strong> is to ask: <strong>"In what other ways could this have been said?"</strong> <cite>[cite: 75]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>By comparing the actual words to the alternatives, you can see the specific social work being done <cite>[cite: 76]</cite>.</li>
                </ul>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Check for Reactions:</strong> You must check the data for how others <strong>react</strong> to the language (e.g., Prof. Vogel's attempted interruption), as this provides evidence for your hypothesis about what was being "built" <cite>[cite: 77]</cite>.</p>

                    <li><strong>Standard English:</strong> This is also a dialect, but it's the one associated with power, education, and media; [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 87]</cite> it is <strong>not</strong> linguistically superior to other dialects. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 88]</cite></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>"Big D" Discourse</strong> is the complete "identity kit" for being a certain "kind of person," like a scientist, gamer, or gang member. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 137]</cite></li>
                    [cite_start]<li>It's different from the other terms in this way: <cite>[cite: 138]</cite>

                            <li><strong>"little d" discourse:</strong> This is <strong>only language-in-use</strong> (e.g., a conversation or a story). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 139]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Social Language:</strong> This is a <strong>component</strong> of a Discourse. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 140]</cite> It's the specific <strong>style of language</strong> (a dialect or register) that a person uses to enact an identity. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 141]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>"Big D" Discourse:</strong> This is the <strong>total package</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 142]</cite> It's the Social Language (the "talk") <strong>PLUS</strong> all the non-language "stuff": how you act, dress, think, value, and use props (the "walk"). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 143]</cite></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>An <strong>"identity kit"</strong> is the author's analogy for all the required parts of a Discourse. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 144]</cite> Like a Barbie-doll "kit" contains the doll, the clothes, the accessories, and the values to "be Barbie", a "scientist kit" contains the lab coat, the technical language, the values (e.g., objectivity), and the tools needed to "be a scientist."

                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>"key to Discourses is 'recognition'"</strong>. It's the central mechanism. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 148]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>"Pulling off" a Discourse:</strong> You successfully "pull off" a Discourse when you combine all the parts of your "identity kit" (language, actions, values, props, etc.) in such a way that <strong>other people recognize you</strong> as a specific "kind of person" (a <strong>who</strong>) doing a specific <strong>activity</strong> (a <strong>what</strong>). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 149]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>When Recognition Fails:</strong> "If it is not recognizable, then you are not 'in' the Discourse". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 150]</cite> The Discourse itself can even die. The text gives the example of the <strong>anti-racist skinhead Discourse</strong>, which was "dying out" because people, including the police, <strong>failed to recognize</strong> its members and confused them with the separate racist neo-Nazi Discourse. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 151]</cite></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. [cite_start]The Key Problem (Conflict & Identity Crisis)</strong> <cite>[cite: 152]</cite></p>
                [cite_start]<p><em>"Using the Scollon and Scollon (1981) study of <strong>Athabaskan students</strong>, discuss how Discourses can conflict. Explain what the author means by an <strong>'identity crisis'</strong> and how the Discourse of 'school-based essayist prose' is 'mutually exclusive' with the Athabaskan Discourse."</em> <cite>[cite: 153]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Athabaskan students faced an <strong>"identity crisis"</strong> because the "way of being" (Discourse) required by their school was <strong>"mutually exclusive"</strong> with their native "way of being". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 154]</cite></li>
                    [cite_start]<li>This conflict happened for two main reasons: <cite>[cite: 155]</cite>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Self-Display:</strong> The school's "essayist prose" Discourse required the student to make a <strong>"major self-display"</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 156]</cite> In the Athabaskan Discourse, this is only appropriate for a person in a <strong>dominant</strong> position, which the student is not. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 157]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Audience:</strong> The school Discourse requires writing for a "decontextualized" or <strong>unknown</strong> audience. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 158]</cite> In the Athabaskan Discourse, when the relationship with the audience is unknown, the preferred response is <strong>"silence"</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 159]</cite></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Therefore, to "pull off" the identity of a "good student," the Athabaskan child was forced to act in a way that was <strong>not</strong> a "good Athabaskan," causing a "crisis in identity". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 160]</cite></li>

                <p><strong>4. [cite_start]The Dynamic Nature (Boundaries & Change)</strong> <cite>[cite: 161]</cite></p>
                [cite_start]<p><em>"The author argues that Discourses are not fixed 'units' and have <strong>'no discrete boundaries'</strong>. Discuss this idea.

                <ul>
                    <li>Discourses are not static "units" because they are <strong>historical</strong>, and people are always contesting and changing them; [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 163]</cite> their "boundaries are always contestable". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 164]</cite></li>
                    <li>Discourses are dynamic and defined in relation to each other. [cite_start]They can: <cite>[cite: 165]</cite>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Split:</strong> A single Discourse can divide. For example, medieval <strong>"natural philosophy" split</strong> into philosophy, physics, and other sciences. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 166]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Meld (Hybridize):</strong> Two or more Discourses can combine. For example, different ethnic gangs <strong>"melded"</strong> to form new "borderland Discourses". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 167]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Die:</strong> A Discourse can "die" when it's no longer performed or recognized. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 168]</cite> The <strong>anti-racist skinhead Discourse</strong> died because it was confused with the racist one. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 169]</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Emerge in Response:</strong> New Discourses emerge in reaction to others. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 170]</cite> The <strong>"new male" Discourse</strong> emerged in the 1970s in response to feminism, and in turn, it changed the feminist Discourse.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Co-construction:</strong> The speaker's identity is "co-constructed" by her and her audience. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 238]</cite> The interviewer isn't interviewing the "same person" who talks to her peers; [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 239]</cite> he is getting a <strong>persona</strong> created in response to him. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 240]</cite> This raises questions about what interview data really means. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 241]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>The "Real Self":</strong> The example asks: Who is the "real" person?. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 242]</cite> The Western view is that the "private" self (with friends) is "real". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 243]</cite> Other views hold that the "public" self (with the interviewer) is the "real" or "better" self. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 244]</cite></li>
                    <li><strong>Embodiment & AI:</strong> The girl's talk with her friends is "profoundly embodied". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 245]</cite> This is contrasted with Generative AI, which can <strong>mimic</strong> identity co-construction but lacks a body, feelings, and emotions, which are central to human cognition and caring.

                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The grammar <strong>alone</strong> produces <strong>112+ possible meanings</strong> (4×4×7). [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 285]</cite></p>
                <p><strong>The Mystery:</strong> Why does <strong>everyone</strong> instantly and unconsciously pick the <strong>same single meaning</strong> (that smoking causes more people to die from lung cancer)?. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 286]</cite></p>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <p><strong>The Answer:</strong> The <strong>"Big C" Conversation</strong>. We all pick the same meaning <strong>not</strong> because of the grammar, but because we are "privy to the ongoing discussion in our society about smoking". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 287]</cite></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Conversation is <strong>more important</strong> than the grammar for fixing the meaning. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 288]</cite></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><strong>The Conclusion:</strong> "Formal" language is <strong>not decontextualized</strong>. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 289]</cite></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It only makes sense when you use its specific Conversational context. [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 290]</cite></li>
                    <li>To teach this language is to embed students "in the Conversational sea in which [it] swims". [cite_start]<cite>[cite: 291]</cite></li>
